### About Me

Read my article on how GIS can help aquatic ecologists working in Mongolian rivers in the [Spring 2017](http://esri.com/esri-news/arcnews/spring17articles/comparing-distant-river-systems-to-assess-the-effects-of-climate-change) edition of ArcNews Magazine.

I'm currently a GIS Analyst and Cartographer in the Keller Science Action Center at the Field Museum in Chicago.

Before moving to Chicago I was an Assistant Researcher and GIS Specialist at the Kansas Biological Survey. My work involved the development of GIS tools for hydrogeomorphic analysis and categorization of river systems, with a focus on temperate steppe rivers in North America and Mongolia.

My research and professional interests include: political ecology, GIS and remote sensing, ecological modeling, tropical land use/land cover monitoring, Amazonia, participatory mapping, and unmanned aerial systems (UAS) applications. See my [Research](www.///.com) page for more information.
