### About Me

Read my article on how GIS can help aquatic ecologists working in Mongolian rivers in the **[Spring 2017](http://esri.com/esri-news/arcnews/spring17articles/comparing-distant-river-systems-to-assess-the-effects-of-climate-change)** edition of ArcNews Magazine.

I'm currently a GIS Analyst and Cartographer in the Keller Science Action Center at the Field Museum in Chicago.

**My research and professional interests include:** political ecology, GIS and remote sensing, ecological modeling, tropical land use/land cover monitoring, Amazonia, and participatory mapping. See my [Research](www.///.com) page for more information.
